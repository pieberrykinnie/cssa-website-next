# What Degree Should I Do?

| Degree | Why Choose It | Typical Path | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| **B.Sc. Major (120 cr)** | Balanced workload, flexible electives | 4 years + optional co‑op | Most common choice |
| **B.C.Sc. Honours (120 cr)** | Deeper CS focus, required thesis | 4 years + thesis + co‑op | Requires higher GPA |
| **Joint Honours (CS + Math/Physics/Stats)** | Love both subjects | 4‑5 years | Great for grad school |
| **B.Sc. Data Science Major** | Passion for statistics & ML | 4 years | Shares many CS courses |

> **Rule of thumb:** If you _might_ pursue graduate studies, choose **Honours**; if you prefer breadth or double‑majors/minors, choose **Major**.

You can **switch programs** later with minimal friction—as long as you meet the GPA/grade requirements.
