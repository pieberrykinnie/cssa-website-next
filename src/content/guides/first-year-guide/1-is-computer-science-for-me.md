# Is Computer Science for Me?

Computer Science (CS) is ultimately about **curiosity**—asking how technology can solve real problems and then _building_ those solutions.

## Why Students Choose CS

- **Endless creativity:** every app, game, or algorithm starts as an idea.  
- **Interdisciplinary reach:** CS powers research in medicine, art, finance—you name it.  
- **Career prospects:** graduates remain in high demand **when they pair skills with passion**.

## Reality Check ✋

| Myth | Reality |
|------|---------|
| “It’s just coding.” | Coding is _one_ tool; CS also covers theory, design, ethics, and people. |
| “You must be a math genius.” | You’ll take **first‑year calculus & discrete math**—challenging but doable with effort. |
| “A CS degree = instant six‑figure job.” | True mastery comes from **consistent practice, community, and curiosity**. |
