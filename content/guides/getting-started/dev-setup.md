# Development Environment Setup

Setting up your development environment is one of the most important first steps as a computer science student. Here's how to get started:

## Operating System Considerations

You can develop software on any major operating system:

- **Windows**: Great compatibility with most software, but some tools require extra configuration
- **macOS**: Popular for development with UNIX-like features and good hardware integration
- **Linux**: Excellent for development with full control over your system

## Essential Software

### Code Editors and IDEs

Here are some recommended code editors and IDEs:

- **Visual Studio Code**: A lightweight, extensible editor suitable for most languages
- **JetBrains IDEs**: Language-specific IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA (Java), PyCharm (Python), etc.
- **Eclipse**: Popular for Java development
- **Sublime Text**: Fast, minimalist editor

### Version Control

Learning Git is essential:

```bash
# Install Git
# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install git

# On macOS with Homebrew
brew install git

# On Windows
# Download from https://git-scm.com/download/win
```

### Setting Up GitHub

1. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/)
2. Set up SSH keys following [GitHub's guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
3. Configure your Git identity:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```
