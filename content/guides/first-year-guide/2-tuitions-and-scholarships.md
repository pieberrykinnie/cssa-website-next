# Tuitions & Scholarships

> **Key takeaway:** _Do the math early_—and remember that **scholarships, co‑op, and research awards** can drastically cut costs.

## Tuition Snapshot (2024‑25)

| Student Type | Cost / credit hour | 24‑credit year (≈4‑5 courses/term) | 30‑credit year |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------------------------|----------------|
| Domestic | **$169.66** | **$4 071.84** | **$5 089.80** |
| International | **$660.99** | **$15 863.76** | **$19 829.70** |

_Add ~ $1 000 for student & facility fees. Co‑op work terms **do not** incur tuition._

## Cutting Costs

1. **Live off‑campus + cook** → save **\$300‑\$400/month** over residence plans.  
2. **Entrance scholarships** – automatically considered when you apply.  
3. **Work‑study & bursaries** – see [Financial Aid & Awards](https://umanitoba.ca/financial-aid-and-awards).  
4. **Co‑op program** – paid 4‑month terms averaging **\$23 / h** (35‑40 h/week).  
5. **Undergraduate Research Awards (URA/USRA)** – **\$7 000‑\$8 500** for a full‑time summer research placement.

> **Pro‑tip:** Domestic students can _fully cover_ tuition with a mix of scholarships + part‑time work.
