# Course Registration

## Must‑Read Documents

- [First Year Planning Guide](https://issuu.com/firstyearcentre/docs/fypg?fr=sZGJmMjYxMDM4MzM)  
- [Steps to Registration](https://umanitoba.ca/registrar/registration/steps-registration)

## Registration Hacks

1. **Prepare CRNs** in a text file. Paste them all the _second_ your time slot opens.  
2. **GPA matters** – higher GPA → earlier Fall/Winter registration.  
3. **Watch the waitlist** – seats often free up after fees are due.  
4. **Missing a prerequisite?** Email an advisor _before_ registration for a temporary override.  
5. **Transfer/AP/IB credit** = fewer courses = smaller wait‑list gamble.

## Summer Term Quirks

- Registration order is based on **student‑number suffix**, not GPA.  
- New blocks of seats open **daily**, so keep checking Aurora.
