# Studying Tactics

First‑year CS courses escalate quickly. Replace high‑school habits with strategies that scale.

## 1. Active Recall & Spaced Repetition

- Quiz yourself _without_ notes (flashcards, whiteboard, friends).  
- Revisit material on Day 1, 3, 7, 14 …

## 2. Teach What You Learn

Explaining a concept in plain English (or meme form) exposes gaps instantly.

## 3. Mix Practice Styles

Combine:

- **Programming labs** (typing code)  
- **Paper tracing** (hand‑simulate algorithms)  
- **Concept maps** (link ideas visually)

## 4. Schedule Like a Project Manager

| Task | Estimate | Deadline | Status |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| COMP 1010 lab 3 | 2 h | Fri 17 May | ☐ |
| MATH 1500 problem set | 5 h | Mon 20 May | ☐ |

Tiny tasks feel achievable; tracking avoids last‑minute chaos.

## 5. Seek Help Early

Office hours, Discord peers, Academic Learning Centre—most problems dissolve after a 10‑minute chat.
