# Self‑Care

University is a marathon, not a sprint. Your **mind and body** fuel grades _and_ happiness.

## Quick Checklist ✅

- **Sleep 7‑9 h/night** – non‑negotiable for memory consolidation.  
- **Move daily** – a brisk 20‑minute walk resets focus.  
- **Eat real food** – protein + colourful veggies > vending‑machine dinner.  
- **Celebrate small wins** – finished COMP lab? Treat yourself to a coffee.  
- **Set boundaries** – say “no” before burnout forces you to.
