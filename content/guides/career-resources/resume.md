# Resume Writing

Your resume is often the first impression you make on potential employers. A well-crafted resume can open doors to interviews and opportunities.

## Resume 101

### Structure and Formatting

A standard technical resume should include:

1. **Contact Information**: Name, email, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub
2. **Education**: Degree, institution, graduation date, relevant coursework
3. **Technical Skills**: Programming languages, frameworks, tools
4. **Experience**: Internships, jobs, research positions
5. **Projects**: Personal or academic projects that showcase your skills
6. **Activities**: Clubs, volunteer work, hackathons

### Formatting Tips

- Keep your resume to one page (especially for students and early career)
- Use a clean, professional design with consistent formatting
- Use bullet points for readability
- Save and send as a PDF to preserve formatting

## Using Action Verbs

Start each bullet point with a strong action verb to describe your accomplishments:

### For Development Work
- Developed, implemented, programmed, coded, engineered
- Designed, architected, modeled, structured
- Debugged, resolved, fixed, troubleshot

### For Research/Analysis
- Analyzed, evaluated, researched, investigated
- Calculated, computed, quantified, measured

### For Leadership/Teamwork
- Led, managed, coordinated, oversaw
- Collaborated, partnered, cooperated
